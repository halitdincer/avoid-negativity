## Inspiration
The Internet is becoming more and more indispensable for our daily life, and although the Internet makes our lives easier every day in new ways, the Internet is a place with a lot of negativity.

With the increasing popularity of the internet every day, we are more and more affected by these negativities on the internet; we are more stressed, our anxiety and depression are getting worse, and in general we are getting more unhappy. 

In addition to our own mental health, the internet becomes less diverse and more unwelcoming place for many people. People are afraid to express themselves because of the severe criticism and judgement on the internet.

I want to create an option for people to use Internet without the toxicity.

## What it does
It is an browse extension to censor negative and toxic content on the Internet. It search for toxic content in every web page that you visit and censor it.

## How we built it
The Negate written mostly in Javascript and it uses cohere-toxicity base model in co:here API for classifying the content.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge for me was being alone in this project. I was not able to attend first half of the hack the valley event and I didn't want to drag  along with me for the risky attempt to build Negate in second half of the event.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am most proud of how great Negate is working at the end. It is able to censor most of the toxic text in almost every web page that I tested on.

## What we learned
I learn how to write browser extensions and how I could incorporate them in my future projects.

## What's next for Negate

Currently, the Negate is only able to process text content in a web page. In the future, it should be able to process medica content as well such as image, audio and video contents.
